## Section 7: Wiring and Installation

### Residential Wiring Systems

Residential electrical systems distribute power throughout homes using standardized wiring methods and components. Understanding these systems enables safe installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of home electrical circuits.

**Service entrance** components bring utility power into the residence and include:

1. **Service drop or lateral**: Overhead or underground conductors from utility lines to the building
2. **Meter base**: Housing for the utility's kilowatt-hour meter that measures energy consumption
3. **Service entrance conductors**: Wires connecting the meter to the main distribution panel
4. **Main disconnect**: Switch or circuit breaker that disconnects all power to the building

**Distribution panels** (also called load centers or breaker boxes) distribute power to individual circuits throughout the home. Key components include:

1. **Main breaker**: Typically 100-200 amperes, provides overcurrent protection and disconnecting means for the entire panel
2. **Bus bars**: Metal bars that distribute power from the main breaker to individual circuit breakers
3. **Circuit breakers**: Automatic protective devices that interrupt circuit current during overloads or short circuits
4. **Neutral bar**: Connection point for all neutral (grounded) conductors
5. **Ground bar**: Connection point for equipment grounding conductors

**Branch circuits** distribute power from the panel to specific areas or devices in the home. Common residential circuit types include:

1. **General lighting circuits**: Typically 15 or 20 amperes, supplying lights and receptacles in living areas
2. **Small appliance circuits**: Dedicated 20-ampere circuits for kitchen countertop receptacles
3. **Individual appliance circuits**: Dedicated circuits for specific appliances like refrigerators, dishwashers, or washing machines
4. **HVAC circuits**: Sized specifically for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment
5. **Special purpose circuits**: For specific applications like electric vehicle charging or hot tubs

**Wiring methods** for residential installations include:

1. **Nonmetallic sheathed cable (NM or Romex)**: Commonly used for interior wiring in dry locations
   - Contains insulated conductors and a bare ground wire in a flexible plastic sheath
   - Typically available in 14 AWG (15A circuits), 12 AWG (20A circuits), and 10 AWG (30A circuits)
   - Color-coded sheaths indicate wire gauge (white for 14 AWG, yellow for 12 AWG, orange for 10 AWG)

2. **Armored cable (AC or BX)**: Metal-clad cable providing additional physical protection
   - Metal armor provides mechanical protection and serves as equipment ground
   - Used in exposed locations or where additional protection is desired

3. **Conduit systems**:
   - EMT (Electrical Metallic Tubing), PVC, or flexible conduit with individual conductors pulled through
   - Used in unfinished spaces, outdoor applications, or where local codes require
   - Provides superior protection and facilitates future wire changes

**Receptacles and switches** provide user interface points for the electrical system:

1. **Receptacle configurations**:
   - Standard 120V, 15A receptacles (NEMA 5-15R) with two slots and a ground
   - 120V, 20A receptacles (NEMA 5-20R) with a distinctive T-shaped neutral slot
   - 240V receptacles in various configurations for appliances like ranges and dryers

2. **Switch types**:
   - Single-pole switches for controlling lights from one location
   - Three-way switches for controlling lights from two locations
   - Four-way switches used in combination with three-way switches for control from three or more locations
   - Dimmer switches for variable light intensity control

### Cable Selection and Circuit Protection

Proper cable selection and circuit protection ensure safe, efficient electrical systems. These components work together to deliver power while preventing hazardous conditions.

**Wire sizing** follows specific guidelines based on current-carrying capacity (ampacity) and voltage drop considerations:

1. **Ampacity**: The maximum current a conductor can carry continuously without exceeding its temperature rating. Factors affecting ampacity include:
   - Conductor material (copper vs. aluminum)
   - Insulation type and temperature rating
   - Installation method (in conduit, free air, etc.)
   - Ambient temperature
   - Number of current-carrying conductors bundled together

2. **Common residential wire sizes and applications**:
   - 14 AWG: 15-ampere circuits for lighting and general-purpose receptacles
   - 12 AWG: 20-ampere circuits for kitchen, laundry, and bathroom receptacles
   - 10 AWG: 30-ampere circuits for electric clothes dryers and water heaters
   - 8 AWG and larger: High-current applications like ranges, HVAC equipment, and service entrances

3. **Voltage drop considerations**: For long circuit runs, wire size may need to be increased beyond minimum ampacity requirements to limit voltage drop. Excessive voltage drop can cause:
   - Dimming lights
   - Poor performance of motors and appliances
   - Increased power consumption and heat generation
   - The National Electrical Code recommends limiting voltage drop to 3% for branch circuits and 5% for the combined feeder and branch circuit.

**Circuit protection devices** safeguard against overcurrent conditions that could damage wiring or create fire hazards:

1. **Circuit breakers** provide resettable overcurrent protection through two mechanisms:
   - Thermal trip: A bimetallic strip that bends when heated by sustained overload current
   - Magnetic trip: An electromagnet that activates during short-circuit conditions, providing instantaneous tripping

2. **Fuses** provide single-use overcurrent protection through a metal element that melts when excessive current flows. Common types include:
   - Edison-base fuses: Screw-in type used in older residential systems
   - Cartridge fuses: Cylindrical type used in industrial applications and some residential panels
   - Type S fuses: Size-specific fuses that prevent installation of incorrect amperage ratings

3. **Special protective devices** address specific hazards:
   - GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter): Detects current leakage to ground as small as 4-6 milliamperes
   - AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter): Detects dangerous arcing conditions that might cause fires
   - GFPE (Ground Fault Protection of Equipment): Similar to GFCI but with higher trip thresholds (typically 30mA), used in equipment protection
   - Surge protective devices: Guard against voltage spikes from lightning or utility switching

**Overcurrent protection coordination** ensures that protective devices operate in the proper sequence during fault conditions:

1. **Selective coordination**: The practice of arranging protective devices so that only the device closest to a fault operates, minimizing the extent of an outage

2. **Series ratings**: Certified combinations of upstream and downstream protective devices that work together to provide adequate fault protection

3. **Time-current curves**: Graphical representations of how quickly a protective device will operate at different current levels, used to analyze coordination between devices
