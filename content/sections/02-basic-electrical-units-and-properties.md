## Section 2: Basic Electrical Units and Properties

### Voltage: The Driving Force of Electricity

**Voltage** represents the fundamental driving force in electrical systems, defined as the potential difference between two points in a conducting path. Voltage measures the electromotive force (EMF) or potential difference that creates the "pressure" necessary to move electrons through a circuit. This electrical pressure can be compared to water pressure in a hydraulic system—just as water pressure pushes water through pipes, voltage pushes electrons through conductors.

One volt represents the amount of potential necessary to cause one coulomb of charge to produce one joule of work. This relationship establishes voltage as a measure of energy per unit charge, quantifying the work required to move electrical charges between two points. Voltage does not flow through circuits; instead, it provides the force that causes current to flow. The presence of voltage is essential for current flow—without voltage, electrons move randomly within conductors and no useful current can be established.

The relationship between voltage and current demonstrates a fundamental electrical principle: current is directly proportional to voltage. When voltage increases in a circuit, current increases proportionally, assuming resistance remains constant. Conversely, when voltage decreases, current decreases accordingly. This proportional relationship forms part of Ohm's Law, one of the most important principles in electrical theory.

Voltage is designated by the symbols **E** or **V** in electrical formulas and circuit diagrams. The letter E originates from "electromotive force," reflecting voltage's historical terminology, while V directly represents the unit of measurement. In modern electrical practice, both symbols are commonly used, with V more prevalent in contemporary applications.

### Current: The Flow of Electrical Charge

**Current** represents the rate of charge flow in electrical systems, measuring how much electrical charge passes a specific point over a given time period. In mathematical terms, current equals charge divided by time: $I = Q/t$. This fundamental relationship establishes current as a measure of electron movement through conductors.

Under normal conditions, free electrons in conductors move randomly without creating useful current. However, when voltage is applied to a material, electrons begin moving in a directed manner from negative toward positive potential. Since electrons carry negative charge, they are repelled by the negative terminal of a voltage source and attracted to the positive terminal. This directed electron movement constitutes electrical current.

An **ampere** (commonly called an amp) serves as the standard unit for measuring current. One ampere represents the flow of one coulomb of charge past a point in one second. To put this in perspective, one ampere means that 6.24 × 10^18 electrons (6.24 billion billion electrons) flow past a single point in a circuit every second. This enormous number illustrates the incredible quantity of electrons involved in even modest electrical currents.

Current measurement uses various submultiples for different applications:
- **Milliamperes (mA)** represent thousandths of an ampere (0.001 A) and are commonly used for measuring current in electronic circuits.
- **Microamperes (µA)** represent millionths of an ampere (0.000001 A) and are used for very small currents in sensitive electronic applications.

In electrical formulas such as Ohm's Law, current is represented by the symbol **I**, which stands for "intensity." The unit "ampere" honors French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775-1836), who made fundamental discoveries about the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

### Resistance: Opposition to Current Flow

**Resistance** represents the opposition to electron flow in electrical circuits. Just as rocks and debris in a river reduce water flow speed and energy, resistance in electrical circuits impedes current flow and dissipates electrical energy. This fundamental property affects how electrical circuits operate and determines how much current flows for a given voltage.

The relationship between resistance and current demonstrates an inverse proportionality: as resistance increases in a circuit, current decreases proportionally. Conversely, when resistance decreases, current increases. This relationship, combined with voltage and current relationships, forms the foundation of Ohm's Law, which states that voltage equals current multiplied by resistance ($V = I × R$).

Resistance is designated by the symbol **R** and measured in **ohms**, represented by the Greek letter omega (Ω). One ohm of resistance allows one ampere of current to flow when one volt is applied across it. This relationship provides a practical way to understand the interaction between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits.

The resistance of materials depends on several factors:

1. **Material composition**: The atomic structure of the material determines its intrinsic resistance.
2. **Length**: Longer conductors have higher resistance because electrons must travel farther, encountering more opposition.
3. **Cross-sectional area**: Thicker conductors have lower resistance because they provide more paths for electrons to flow.
4. **Temperature**: For most metals, resistance increases with temperature due to increased atomic vibration.

**Resistors** are devices specifically designed to introduce controlled amounts of resistance into circuits. They serve multiple purposes: limiting current flow, dividing voltage, and generating heat for specific applications. Resistors are categorized into two main types: fixed resistors and variable resistors.

**Fixed resistors** have predetermined resistance values that cannot be changed during normal operation. They are available in a wide range of resistance values and are manufactured using various technologies, including carbon-composite, metal film, and chip array configurations. The most commonly used type is the carbon-composite resistor, which uses color-coded bands to indicate its resistance value and tolerance.

The color coding system for resistors provides a standardized method for identifying resistance values:

- Four-band resistors use the first two bands to represent digits, the third band as a multiplier (number of zeros), and the fourth band to indicate tolerance.
- Five-band resistors use the first three bands for digits, the fourth band as a multiplier, and the fifth band for tolerance.

For example, a four-band resistor with red (2), green (5), brown (×10), and gold (±5%) bands would have a resistance of 250 ohms with ±5% tolerance.

**Variable resistors** allow resistance values to be adjusted during operation. They serve two primary functions:
- **Potentiometers** for voltage division (three-terminal devices) 
- **Rheostats** for current control (typically two-terminal devices)

A potentiometer has three terminals and uses a moving contact (wiper) to tap different voltages from a fixed resistance element. Potentiometers are commonly used in volume controls, speed controls for DC motors, and various adjustment circuits.

### Methods of Voltage Production

Electrical systems require sources of electromotive force to create the voltage necessary for current flow. Six primary methods exist for producing voltage, each converting different forms of energy into electrical energy. Understanding these methods provides insight into how various electrical devices and power generation systems operate.

1. **Friction EMF (Triboelectric Effect)** occurs when certain materials are rubbed together, causing electrons to transfer from one material to another. This principle explains static electricity generation and is used in Van de Graaff generators and some specialized applications.

2. **Pressure EMF (Piezoelectric Effect)** generates voltage when mechanical pressure is applied to certain crystalline materials like quartz. This effect is reversible—applying voltage to these materials causes mechanical deformation. Piezoelectric devices are used in microphones, speakers, precision positioning systems, and quartz watches.

3. **Heat EMF (Thermoelectric Effect)** produces voltage when junctions of dissimilar metals are heated. This phenomenon, known as the Seebeck effect, forms the basis for thermocouples used in temperature measurement and thermoelectric generators that convert waste heat into electricity.

4. **Light EMF (Photoelectric Effect)** generates voltage when light strikes photosensitive materials. This principle enables solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity and forms the basis for photovoltaic power generation, light meters, and various optical sensors.

5. **Chemical EMF** results from chemical reactions between different materials. This method powers batteries and fuel cells, where chemical energy converts directly to electrical energy. Different battery chemistries (lead-acid, lithium-ion, alkaline) use various chemical reactions to produce voltage.

6. **Magnetic EMF (Electromagnetic Induction)** generates voltage when a conductor moves through a magnetic field or when a magnetic field changes around a conductor. This principle, discovered by Michael Faraday, forms the foundation for electrical generators that produce most of the world's electricity.
